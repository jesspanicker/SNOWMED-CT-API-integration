**SNOMED CT API INTEGRATION**

This Python script provides simple functions to interact with the SNOMED International API to retrieve concept details and map clinical terms to SNOMED CT concept IDs. It allows for retrieving details of SNOMED CT concepts by concept ID and mapping clinical terms to SNOMED codes for clinical data standardization.

**Requirements:**

Python 3.x
Requests library: Install via pip install requests.

**Setup:**

API Key: The script requires a SNOMED API key to authenticate requests. Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the headers dictionary with your actual API key.
SNOMED API Base URL: This example uses "https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/snowstorm/snomed-ct" as the base URL. Will need adjusting as necessary.
